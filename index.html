<!-- Sophia's Library Requirements-->
<!-- it should keep track of how many books are currently in the library -->
<!-- it should have a visual cue if the lib inventory that includes who /when/ qty -->
<!-- it should check out a book while documenting the quantity of books taken by "name " of student-->
<!-- make drop downlists for books and qty .. they should be beside each other -->
<!-- make a button for name of books that shows the books / makes a student select and also how many(qty) -->
<!-- sort the books in alphabetical order
 -->
<!--  psuedo code -->
<!-- make input tags for name of student/ time /student checks out also print the time.
if possible a visual of what the book looks like  -->

<!-- make a funtion for books that give you name of book/ title, quantity, when the book was added or removed and returned into the library, also make a function for the chekout button/ return and borrow

 make an object that gives you name of student, title of book, date and time / quantity of book taken by the student -->
 <!-- name of book
      students name 
      qty of books per person
      time the book was taken
	add more to the list of books in the library

 -->


 <!-- create a function that allows the user to add books that include title , author, and a button ti change the read status to yes or no
// have a statement that says when you take out one book the qty drops
		 
 -->
<!-- for the function that adds and remove
you will need a condition that shows if stdent a removes "book" reduce qty to amount student reduces by and show// make a limit of 1 book per student
alert prompt for remove and add -->
 <!-- how do you determine if the student has read the book for the yes/no -->
